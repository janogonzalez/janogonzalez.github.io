A young programmer visited the Master with the hope of becoming wiser.

"Master, how can I walk the True Path" asked the programmer.

The Master smiled and said "It's easy, to walk the True Path you shall only use
TDD".

The programmer was happy and got back to study TDD and applied it to every
project from that moment on.

A long time passed and the programmer went to see the Master again.

"Thank you master. I've followed your advice, now I only use TDD and I walk the
True Path" the programmer said with enthusiasm.

"Fool. To walk the True Path you shall not use TDD ever" replied the Master.

The True Path became so clear that the programmer was absorbed by its void.
