Recently I have been presenting a talk with the name "The bipolar programmer"
a name that is offensive because [Bipolar disorder][1] is a real disease
suffered by real people. I never give it a thought until a colleage recently
gave me feedback about the talk.

To increase the diversity in our field, language that can cause people to feel
excluded can not be used. I believe that is very important to think not only
of our intentions but also of the effect that our language can have in others.

I have changed the name of the talk to "Two programmers in one" which is also
more representative of its contents. I can't change the past but at least I
can improve for the future.

Please accept my sincere apologies.
