We went to a family vacation in Amsterdam. When we travel we take things slowly so we didn't do too much.

Some highlights of the trip include:

- Visiting the [Moco Museum][moco]
- Visiting the [Van Gogh Museum][van-gogh]
- Visiting the [NEMO Science Museum][nemo]
- Eating [Shokupan][shokupan] from [Best Bread Boba][best-bread-boba]
- Eating in the floating Chinese restaurant [Sea Palace][sea-palace]

Thanks to a former colleague, now you can actually find the Atom feed of the posts. He made me realize the feed wasn't linked anywhere and suggested adding a `rel` link to it. I also added a link in the footer.

## Media

Playing:
- [Slay the Spire+][slay-the-spire-plus]. I didn't bring the Switch to my trip so I played one of my travel games

Watching:
- [Itaewon Class][itaewon]

Listened to:
- [Fleshvessel - Obstinacy: Sisyphean Dreams Unfolded][fleshvessel] (Also on [Bandcamp][fleshvessel-bandcamp]). Avant-Garde Metal release from last year, it's great and has the right amount of weirdness
- [Funeral Dancer - Inner Gate][funeral] (Also on [Bandcamp][funeral-bandcamp]). It's Black 'n' Roll baby!
- [SUMIN & Slom \[MINISERIES LIVE : SISUN \| SYNC NEXT 25\]][sumin]. SUMIN & Slom playing 20 songs live!
- My favorite recently released single was [Hällas - Above the Continuum][haellas]. I can also recommend [Mayhem - Realm of Endless Misery][mayhem], [She Past Away - Mizantrop][mizantrop], [tripleS - Tokimetique][triples]

Watched:
- [Doona!][doona]. Ironically, after watching [last week][last-week] a video about Netflix ruining K-Drama I watched a Netflix K-Drama. This was a recommendation from my resident K-Drama expert. A romance story of a college student and a K-Pop star, what could go wrong?
- [Ponyo][ponyo]. Great to watch in family
- [The trailer][trailer] for a new Ghost in the Shell anime. The art style looks similar to the original manga!
- GothamChess covering the rest of the [Tata Steel Chess Tournament][tata] ([1][tata-1], [2][tata-2], [3][tata-3])
- [Big Tech Confused about AI][ai]
- [When you accidentally ruin your show][ruin]
