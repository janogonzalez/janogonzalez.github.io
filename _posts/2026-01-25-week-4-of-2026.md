Everyone but me has been sick at home this week. I've been taking care of my family.

I tried (and failed) to get tickets to the [BTS][bts] concert in Munich. I was assigned around number 160.000 in the queue for a venue with 75.000 people capacity.

Finished the [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization][mml]. The last course was slightly annoying, for example an exercise is still wrong after 2 years of reports in the course forum.


## Updates
- Reached level 6 in [WaniKani][wanikani] but I still have words from level 5 to learn

## Media

Playing:
- [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild][botw]

Listened to:
- [Fuath - III][fuath] (Also on [Bandcamp][fuath-bandcamp]). Nice Atmospheric Black Metal with long songs
- [Nourishment - Nourishment][nourishment]. Interesting mix of Black Metal and Coldwave
- [Oraculum - Hybris Divina][oraculum] (Also on [Bandcamp][oraculum-bandcamp]). Old-school sounding Chilean Death Metal. Absolute banger of an album, this may become one of my favorite releases of 2026
- [static.grl - GO UNTIL YOU ARE GONE 2013.04-07][static] (Also on [Bandcamp][static-bandcamp]). Cool random recommendation from YouTube
- [Thrä - lact’eben][thra] (Also on [Bandcamp][thra-bandcamp]). Random Black Metal recommendation from Spotify. It's the [same artist behind Sadness][sadness] and a dozen of other projects, how can a musician be so prolific?
- [Zu - Ferrum sidereum][zu] (Also on [Bandcamp][zu-bandcamp]). Avant-Garde Metal album released this month. I need more Metal with Saxophone on it
- [Alfa Mist - Live at Real World Studios][alpha-mist]
- A couple of recently released singles, my favorite is probably [The Claypool Lennon Delirium - WAP][wap]. Other songs I can recommend are [Lone - Life Spark][lone], [Pasocom Music Club − tenk(e)i feat. Hakushi Hasegawa][tenkei], [Re:Hearts - Persona][rehearts], [XG - HYPNOTIZE][xg]

Watched:
- [Ping Pong the Animation][ping-pong]. Re-watched one of my favorite anime series. An exploration of purpose, joy, mastery and other topics
- [Yaeji Gives A Tour of Her Playful Powerful Creative Studio][yaeji]
