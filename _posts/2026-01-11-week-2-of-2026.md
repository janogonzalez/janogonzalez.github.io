A cold snowy week in Berlin. The holidays are over so I'm back to my regular routine.

Started the third and final course in the [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization][mml] and spent more time than expected wrapping my head around the [covariance matrix][covariance-matrix].

## Updates

- Reached level 5 in [WaniKani][wanikani]
- Trying [Ghostty][ghostty]. It _feels_ snappier that the default macOS terminal. Is worth it to install an extra program? I don't it know yet

## Media

Playing:
- [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild][botw]. This will continue being my only game for a few months I guess

Listened to:
- [CHUU - XO, My Cyberlove][xo-my-cyberlove]. CHUU's last year EP was one of my [favorites][2025-music] so I was hyped for this release. Besides the [title track](xo-title-track) and a couple more the album didn't do it for me. May re-evaluate in a couple of months
- [Hesse Kassel - La Brea][la-brea] (Also on [Bandcamp][la-brea-bandcamp]). Re-listening to this Chilean release from 2025. If I didn't speak Spanish this would be in my [top 10 of 2025][2025-music], but I'm getting more used to the lyrics now
- [idntt - \<yesweare>][yesweare]. The [title track][yesweare-title-track] is fun so I expected more from the EP
- [KIRINJI - TOWN BEAT][town-beat]. Great random Spotify recommendation. Apparently this style is called [Sophisti-Pop][sophisti-pop]?
- [Mortajas - Mortajas II][mortajas-ii] (Also on [Bandcamp][mortajas-ii-bandcamp]). Chilean Doom Metal recommendation from a non-Chilean friend
- [Ulver - Neverland][neverland] (Also on [Bandcamp][neverland-bandcamp]). You never know what style you'll get with a new Ulver album. This is kinda ambient. I'll re-listen to it in the future
- [V/R Converters - ニューラルへ縹渺][vr-converters]: Another great random Spotify recommendation. I need to know more about this band
- Singles like [Bruno Mars - I Just Might][i-just-might], [HANABIE - Iconic][iconic], [Mayhem - Life is a Corpse you Drag][life-is-a-corpse-you-drag], [Zanias - The Spire][the-spire]. **Fun fact:** I sold a [Roland TR-8][tr-8] to Zanias a couple of years ago

Watched:
- [Saiko no Kyoshi: Ichinengo, Watashi wa Seito ni Sareta (English: The Greatest Teacher)][the-greatest-teacher]: My first J-Drama, it was dramatic enough
