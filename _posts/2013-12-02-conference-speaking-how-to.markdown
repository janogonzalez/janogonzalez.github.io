One of the things I enjoy the most is going to conferences, not only as part of
the audience but also sharing my own experiences on stage. You can learn a lot
when it's you the one who is speaking.

But how to become a conference speaker?

## Start small

Before thinking about speaking in conferences start speaking in your work,
university or local user group. When you get used to prepare a talk and
delivering it in public you will become more confident. Conference speaking
like every other skill requires practice to master.

## Apply to conferences

This seems really obvious, but please let me repeat it:
**Apply to conferences**.

The best way to get your first talk accepted is to send proposals to a lot of
conferences. I use [lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com) to find conferences with open
CFPs.

[RubyConf Uruguay 2011](rubyconfuy) was the first conference outside Chile I
applied to. I sent my proposal without any hopes to get accepted, but
surprinsingly they liked it. Remember that a great number of conferences are
willing to give you your first chance to speak.

Regarding to the proposal itself I don't have too much tips to share, I still
have to improve a lot in that aspect. Just try to be clear about how the talk
will be useful for the audience, let the organizers know about its structure
and tell them why you are the right person to speak about that subject.

## Prepare your talk

Your slides must have good contrast, remember that projectors suck 99% of the
time. Big fonts are necessary because some people will be watching from a
considerable distance. Also, remember to don't include too much text in your
slides otherwise people will become distracted reading, and you want them to
hear you with attention. I learned a lot about preparing slides with a
[great post from Zach Holman](
http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/).

Avoid the temptation of live coding unless you are really experienced doing it,
some people just record videos. If you need internet always have a plan B,
remember that conference WiFi sucks 99% of the time.

It is very important to rehearse standing and actually speaking, don't make the
mistake of rehearsing only with your thoughts, remember that when you think
words come quickier than when you speak. When you have mastered your timing you
are ready to the conference. You can give your talk in front of your colleagues
or in small meetups first to get early feedback.

When you already are in the venue you can test your slides to check the
contrast.

**Be respectful**: Remember that the audience and the organizers have invested
time and money, rehearse your talk to deliver the content the best way possible
in the given time slot and don't include offensive things in your slides (e.g.
sexists jokes).

## Speak

If you are like me you will probably get very nervous before your talk, don't
eat heavy and remember to go to the bathroom before speaking. Have a bottle of
water to don't get a sore throat.

Before starting take one or two deep breaths to calm down, remember to control
the speed of your voice because when people get anxious or are too passionate
about a subject they tend to speak too quickly.

Make good use of your presentation software. In the presenter screen I always
have the timer of how much time I have left, the current slide and the next
slide. In the last conference I spoke, I made the mistake of speaking to much
in the first slide forgetint that the timer starts when you pass to the second
slide, to avoid that mistake many people suggest to put a blank slide first or
to repeat the first slide and inmediately switch to the next to start the
timer.

If you have rehearsed properly your talk, you can easly compensate your timing
problems by going slower or faster in some points. Remember to look from time
to time in which slide you are and how much time you have left.

If you have a problem don't freak out, just ignore it or make a small joke
about it.

There are some rules like don't move too much, don't stand looking down,
etc. but don't try to be another person on stage. For example I move a lot my
arms while speaking and that can be distracting, but that's part of the way I
express myself and I won't (actually, I can't) change it.

When you are speaking get feedback from the audience looking at their faces,
are they enthusiatic about your talk? bored? amused?

After you finish, answer the questions of the audience and if you don't know
something don't worry, nobody is gonna crucify you.

## Be humble

Accept the feedback without being a smartass, share with the audience after
your talk. Don't believe you are better or more capable for being on stage.

## Repeat and improve

If the conference has videos watch yourself (and become a little embarrased),
then improve your weak points. Try to get honest feedback, in my case it was
my wife who told me about the problems with my voice speed, excessive movement,
etc.

I promise that you will improve over time.

## Conclusion

Conference speaking is a really rewarding activity. I have learned a lot, had
a great time and made lots of friends in different parts of the world. You
should try it!
