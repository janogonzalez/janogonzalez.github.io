I decided to use [Jekyll][jekyll] for my website again, mostly because I love
writing [Markdown][markdown] on [Vim][vim]. But instead of thinking about
a good CSS layout I just started using the default template that's quite
decent. I think that's always better to publish something without bugs that you
can improve later than waiting for the perfect version.
