If you are a man reading this post, let me start with the bad news: We don't
have a clue about how it feels to be a woman in tech. Actually, we don't have a
clue about how it feels to be a woman. Period.

One of my best friends is a great developer and team leader and she always have
to deal with the issue of people don't trusting her technical skills when they
first met her. It's like if in our field women need to do extra effort to be
recognized as valuable members of a team.

And of course there is the problem that almost **every women** I have met in my
life has dealt with a stalker, feeling threatened by groups of men yelling
nasty things at them, having her ass grabbed by a random stranger in the street
or being assaulted in even more horrifying ways.

While I can empathize with that I really **don't know** how it feels to be a
woman.

Why worry about it if I'm a man? First of all, common decency. But also I just
don't want to raise a daughter (or son) in a world where all rules for women
are created by men, where people count her number of sexual partners to judge
if she is a "slut" or not, where she can't dress the way she wants for fear
of being assaulted or again being called a slut, where she needs to double her
efforts to be noticed as a good professional or where people would blame her if
she is assaulted by a man.

So, what can we do to improve this as men? First of all, we need to **shup the
fuck up** and start listening to what women have to say, maybe we can learn a
thing or two.

Finally, I want to say thank you to people like

[Shanley Kane](https://twitter.com/shanley) who
have raised awareness about the lack of diversity in our field.
