A programmer was troubled and sad, so he went to see his Master.

"Nobody recognizes my work" the programmer said with woeful voice.

The Master took him to a temple with a beautiful stone statue in the center and
said "If you want your work to be recognized you must be like the person who
made this statue".

They kept walking for a couple of minutes until the programmer asked "Who made
it?".

"I don't know" replied the Master.

Suddenly, the programmer was enlightened.
