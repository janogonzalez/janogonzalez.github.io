description: Notes for week 3 of 2026

I was slightly sick at the beginning of the week and skipped exercise a couple of days. For me, the hardest part of maintaining a daily habit is returning to it after "breaking the chain".

This is my third week posting notes and I'm starting to see a pattern. Should I just rename them to "what I listened to this week"?

I'm seeing more Chilean bands with a [talk-singing][sprechgesang] style popping up. Maybe that's the solution for me to finally release music with lyrics?
By the week, today I learned that the German word Sprechgesang is used to refer to this style of singing in English.

## Updates

- Installed [`aspell`][aspell] to do some basic spell checking on future notes
- Reached the final module of the [Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA][pca] course

## Media

Playing:
- [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild][botw]. I'm enjoying the game more and more as I play it

Listened to:
- [baan - neumann][neumann] (Also on [Bandcamp][neumann-bandcamp]). Revisiting this Korean Post-Hardcore release from 2025
- [Ellende - Zerfall][zerfall] (Also on [Bandcamp][zerfall-bandcamp]). At first, I found the production "too modern sounding" for my liking. When I listened to it a second time, it finally convinced me
- [Fuki Kitamura - Spira1oop][spira1oop]. Again bumping into interesting Japanese music thanks to a Spotify recommendation
- [LOLOET - Circle of Echoes][circle-of-echoes] (Also on [Bandcamp][circle-of-echoes-bandcamp]). Great Japanese fresh release found thanks to Spotify recommendations. The leader of this experimental project used to be a J-Pop idol
- [Oranssi Pazuzu - Muuntautuja][muuntautuja] (Also on [Bandcamp][muuntautuja-bandcamp]). I haven't listened to this Avant-Garde Metal band in years and I randomly bumped into this great release from 2024
- [The Armed - The Future Is Here and Everything Needs to Be Destroyed][the-future] (Also on [Bandcamp][the-future-bandcamp]). Revisiting this noisy Post-Hardcore release from last year
- [Renatto Olivares - Aguas Raras][aguas-raras] (Also on [Bandcamp][aguas-raras-bandcamp]). This may become one of my favorite releases of 2026. Another Chilean project with talk-singing
- A Drum & Bass radio show recording [Jubei & J:Kenzo @ SWU.FM 26 december 2025][jubei-j-kenzo]
- [Catherine Fears' piano cover][cf-piano-cover] of Emperor - I Am The Black Wizards
- [Sarah Belle Reid playing][sbr-playing] one of the four [Buchla Touché][buchla-touche] synths ever made
- Many recently released singles, my favorite is probably [The Messthetics, James Brandon Lewis - Gestations][gestations] and some highlights include [ALPHA DRIVE ONE - FREAK ALARM][freak-alarm], [Flea feat. Thom Yorke - Traffic Lights][traffic-lights], [Haute & Freddy - Dance The Pain Away][dance-the-pain-away], [ILLIT - Sunday Morning][sunday-morning], [In Inertia - Of All Things I Yearn For][of-all-things], [Isobel - limn][limn], [KiiKii - Delulu][delulu], [León Larregui - Bruma][bruma], [Phydra ft. Blank - Buster][buster], [Puscifer - ImpetuoUs][impetuous], [PVA - Peel][peel], [trauma ray - Hannibal][hannibal], [YOASOBI - アドレナ][yoasobi]
