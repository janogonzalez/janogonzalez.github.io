This year I want to publish weeknotes, following the example of [Denis][denis] and [Eduardo][eduardo].

It has been a slow week because of the holidays. I didn't do too much and had some nice rest. We didn't travel during the holidays so we have been just chilling in family.

I feel this New Year the fireworks in Berlin were less noisy than the last. We contributed to pollution (regular, not noise) by burning some [sparklers][sparklers].

## Updates

- I'm [bullet journaling][bullet-journaling] again. It helps me to declutter my mind and to remember things. I want to be more consistent than last year
- Doing some light exercise daily. I want to become more active
- Using my phone less. I've also set the screen to grayscale to reduce visual estimulation
- Sold the DIY Eurorack modules that I never soldered
- Reached level 4 in [WaniKani][wanikani]. I've been learning some [Kanji][kanji]. I should be prioritizing German but _the heart wants what it wants_

## Media

Playing:
- [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild][botw]. Better late than never

Watching:
- [Saiko no Kyoshi: Ichinengo, Watashi wa Seito ni Sareta (English: The Greatest Teacher)][the-greatest-teacher]

Listened to:
- [Maruja - Pain to Power][pain-to-power] because of all the hype during 2025

Watched:
- The 39C3 talk [From Silicon to Darude Sand-storm: breaking famous synthesizer DSPs][39c3-talk]. The reverse engineering process of the [JP-8000](jp-8000) was interesting and the best part was learning the secrets of the original Supersaw
- GothamChess' coverage of the FIDE World Rapid & Blitz Championships 2025 ([1][gotham-1], [2][gotham-2], [3][gotham-3], [4][gotham-4], [5][gotham-5])
- The [Stranger Things][stranger-things] finale
