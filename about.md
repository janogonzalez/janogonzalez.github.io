# Hi!

I'm Jano Gonz√°lez, a Senior Software Engineer with over 15 years experience.

My last gig was as a Staff Engineer for [Contentful][contentful] and previously
I was breaking down [SoundCloud][soundcloud]'s monolith into microservices.
Before that, I was the CTO for a small startup, spent many years writing
middleware for banks and retail and led engineering teams.

I enjoy mentoring and [public speaking](/talks). My last talk was in
[LISA 2019][lisa].

In my free time I make [music][music].
