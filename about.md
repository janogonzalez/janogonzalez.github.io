Hi! I'm Jano, a Senior Software Engineer based in Berlin.

I work as a Staff Engineer for [Contentful][contentful].

Previously, I was breaking down [SoundCloud][soundcloud]'s monolith into
microservices. Before that, I was the CTO for a small startup and also spent
many years creating middleware for banks and retail.

I enjoy mentoring and [public speaking](/talks). My last talk was in
[LISA 2020][lisa].

I also enjoy making [music][music].
