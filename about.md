Hi! I'm Jano, a Senior Software Engineer based in Berlin.

I work as a Staff Engineer for the Reliability team in
[Contentful][contentful].

Previously, I was breaking down [SoundCloud][soundcloud]'s monolith into
microservices. Before that, I was the CTO for a small startup and also spent
many years creating middleware for banks and retail.

I also make [music][music]. In the last few years I've focused on synths,
specially modular ones.
